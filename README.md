# Predicting CO2 from smart city perspective
CO2 prediction by new vehicles


In this project, I conducted a supervised learning analysis using regression models to predict a continuous target variable based on a set of input features. The primary objective was to explore the relationships between the predictors and the target variable and develop an accurate predictive model. The dataset used for this analysis is taken from the Government site.

Various Models Used:

Linear Regression:
Linear regression is a base model used in this project. It establishes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable by fitting a straight line to the data points. The model assumes a constant and additive relationship between the predictors and the target. 


Other models used are :Support Vector Regressor, Decision Trees, Random Forest,Lazy regressor, LSTM and Artificial Neural Network.


Overall, I compared the performance of these regression models using various evaluation metrics, such as mean squared error, mean absolute error, and R-squared, to identify the most suitable model for our dataset. Through this comprehensive analysis, we gained valuable insights into the relationships between the predictors and the target variable, enabling us to make accurate predictions.
